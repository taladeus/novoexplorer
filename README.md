## Prerequisites

1. Install and run a full, archiving node - https://github.com/novobitcoin/novobitcoin-release. Ensure that your node has full transaction indexing enabled (`txindex=1`) and the RPC server enabled (`server=1`).
2. Synchronize your node with the Bitcoin network.
3. "Recent" version of Node.js (8+ recommended).

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/taladeus/novoexplorer`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
4. Edit the "rpc" settings in [app/credentials.js](app/credentials.js) to target your node
5. Optional: Change the "coin" value in [app/config.js](app/config.js).
6. Optional: Add an ipstack.com API access key to [app/credentials.js](app/credentials.js). Doing so will add a map to the /peers page.
